# beautiful_counter ðŸŒ’

Built using the popular Flutter framework. This is a Beautiful Counter App. I remade it like it was a pimp my ride episode. 

### Some concepts that were utilised in the development of this app
- Bloc State management
- Bloc Architecture: Separation of concerns (Logic vs UI)
- Flutter animations: Rive
- Custom Theming: Light Mode vs Dark Mode (Dynamic)
- Data Persistence: Hive/Hydrated Bloc
- Modularize: Refactoring Widgets
- Event-driven programming
- Pubspec.yaml for external Packages like Google Font assets
